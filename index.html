<h2>Project Execution & Integration</h2>

<p>
This project is implemented using a hybrid approach.
The frontend of the Vehicular Rental System is hosted online
using GitHub Pages, which provides a public website link.
</p>

<p>
The backend logic such as user registration, vehicle viewing,
booking, and bill calculation is implemented using Java and
MySQL through JDBC in Eclipse.
</p>

<h3>Backend Execution</h3>
<p>
Backend operations are executed locally in Eclipse.
Booking details are stored in the MySQL database and
displayed in the console output.
</p>

<h3>Sample Booking Output</h3>
<pre>
Username: Rash
Vehicle ID: 1
Days: 2

Booking Successful
Total Amount: ₹3000
</pre>

<p>
This website acts as the project interface and documentation,
while backend processing is handled by the Java application.
